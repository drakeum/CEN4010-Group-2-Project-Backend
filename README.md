# CEN4010-Group-2-Project-Backend
Backend for a web-based property management system for the City of Happy Citizens :)

# Background
This project was created for my Principles of Software Engineering class for a group project. I coded it all in Java Spring Boot, and it was connected to an AWS RDS PostgreSQL database.
The application was for a website where users would keep records of owned properties, and I made all the appropriate APIs me and my group would need.
While not very useful on its own, this backend app is now public as a record of projects I've worked on.
